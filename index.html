          <h2>About me </h2>
            <p> My passion for programming comes from building programs that are useful to other people. Much like art and architecture, programming allows me to create beautiful and functional programs. Another reason why I am passionate about programming is because if you can think it, you can make it a reality. My main goal as a software engineer is to program websites that can be easily access by people with disabilities using Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA). </p>
            <p> One of my passions is working with teams. One of the reaons why I enjoy working in teams is the moral support you get from your team. This makes it harder to procastinate, builds profressional relationships, and increaes your value as a programmer. A second reason why I enjoy working in teams is because it is way to learn best practices about your program, introduces new ideas, and it makes programs easier to debug. Lastly I am looking forward to work in teams because programmers bring their prior experience to the table, they may evaluate a problem in a different manner helping you broad your way of thinking about a problem. </p>
            <p> Outside of programming I enjoy traveling to National Parks. I also enjoy camping, hiking, snowboarding, and playing tennis. On my spare time I also volunteer at my local animal shelter.  </p>
