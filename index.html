          <h2>About me </h2>
          <p> I first became interested in programming when I took an HTML course as an elective in college. Since then I have been really interested in full stack web development. I am currently working as a seasonal program developer at Amazon. </p>
          <p> The reason why I decided to join Thinkful is because I would like to get a deeper understanding and practice on creating programs in different languages and improve my programming skills </p>
          <p> Outside of programming, I enjoy traveling to National Parks, hiking, camping, snowboarding and playing raquetball. I also enjoy volunteering at my local animal shelter.  </p>
